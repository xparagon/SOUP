# SOUP

> The **S**imple **O**pen **U**nified **P**rocess. A guidebook for web programmers

As web programmers we love tools, and frameworks, and protocols? standards? principles? and work methods?<br>
Well - if it was all presented in a simple way and easily available - that would help! 

?> And that is the goal of **SOUP**: To make the day of a programmer easier and more efficient.

No guide can help for all development cases, so we have limited this to development of:
- [x] **Progressive Web Applications ([PWA's](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/))**
    - Responsive Web Apps: Mobile (first?), Tablet and Web
    - Desktop ready (using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/))
- [x] **Cloud Based solutions** from:
    - Google [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) or
    - Microsoft [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) 

Some features that we expect to be important:
- [x] Open ID Connect
- [x] Websocket 
- [x] REST API
- [x] Webhooks


## Simple

If it ain't simple - it will not be used!

## Open

This is for all that find it useful. 

## Unified

If we can agree everything is easier!

## Process

It is web-development from A to Z.
