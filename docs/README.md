# SOUP

> SOUP is a **S**imple **O**pen **U**nified **P**rocess. A guidebook for web programmers

That purpose of **SOUP** is simple: To make *my* day as a programmer easier and more efficient.



- **Simple**<br />
If it ain't simple - it ain't useful!

- **Open**<br />
It is for all that finds it useful. 

- **Unified**<br />
Opinionated is better than "anything that works is OK" - it is not!

- **Process**<br />
Improvements is a struggle - a never ending process.
