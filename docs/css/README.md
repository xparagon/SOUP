# CSS

Should you 
- choose a UI-framework and use the CSS provided?
    - in Bootstrap?
    - in Quasar?
    - in Vuetify?
- choose a css-framework
    - tailwind
- or combine this?
- or make your own css?

I prefer a good UI-framework, like Quaser for Vue, but Tailwind seems to be simpler and more flexible. The UI-framework CSS library could develop to become more like Tailwind, but until then the option to combine is tempting. 

After all, a UI-framework invite you to make custom components, so there is no need to repeat the use of class-names again and again when you can use a custom component. 

See the [COMPONENT-DRIVEN](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/extracting-components) page for more information.
