# SOUP

> The **S**imple **O**pen **U**nified **P**rocess. A guidebook for web programmers

 
\- That is the goal of **SOUP**: To make *my* day as a programmer easier and more efficient.

Now with some notes about [react](./react) and how to write [documentation](./docs). 

## Simple

If it ain't simple - it ain't useful!

## Open

It is for all that finds it useful. 

## Unified

Opinionated is better than "anything that works is OK" - it is not!

## Process

Improvements is a struggle - a never ending process.
