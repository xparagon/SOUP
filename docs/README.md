# SOUP

> SOUP is a **S**imple **O**pen **U**nified **P**rocess. A guidebook for web programmers

That purpose of **SOUP** is simple: To make *my* day as a programmer easier and more efficient.



- **Simple**<br />
If it ain't simple - it ain't useful!

- **Open**<br />
It is for all that finds it useful. 

- **Unified**<br />
Opinionated is better than "anything that works is OK" - it is not!

- **Process**<br />
Improvements is a struggle - a never ending process.

## Hello

I have created 3 starter project to test react, vue and svelte:

>yarn create vite hello-react-ts --template react-ts<br />
yarn create vite hello-svelte-ts --template svelte-ts<br />
yarn create vite hello-vue-ts --template vue-ts

## Storybook

I have also created a starter repro to test out storybook, with the hope to create a component library and a design system:

* tables - with sorting, filtering, pagination, ...
* service workers - running in separate threads
* micro-framework - combining multiple web-apps
